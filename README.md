# shape-engine-cpp
A tiny inference sample with onnx-tool's compute graph and shape engine.  
It implements cpp version of onnx-tool's compute graph and shape engine loader. It allows you to use the graph structure and runtime dynamic shape engine serialized by onnx-tool.  
This repo also creates a tiny template inference engine for ResNet18 model. This inference engine supports dynamic input tensor shapes with compiled size of ~70KB.
